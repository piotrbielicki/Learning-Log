# Learning-Log
Learning Log is a simply application created in Python using Django and Bootstrap.
User can register an account, add new topics, add posts in specific topic to track his progress in
learning. I also add a little feature that sends me a personalized SMS every time new account is created and post is published or edited. For this i used telesign's API for sending SMS. 
Project is not finished yet. I have to add all the login required permissions and maybe a little script scrapping some interesting articles and publishing them automatically.
